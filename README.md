How wrong are language models when you ask them for an emission factor with no
tools — and, worse, how often do they name the wrong source for a number?

**467 questions, 45 sections, 75 publishers**, generated deterministically
(seed 20260910) from data version 2026.187. Only factors we may republish are
used, so the answer key ships with the benchmark.

Questions are phrased the way a practitioner asks, not as canonical keys:

> What is the greenhouse-gas emission factor for UK grid electricity —
> location-based, per kWh?

## What is measured

| Metric | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| `answered` / `declined` | does it give a number at all |
| `within_10pct` | is the number right |
| `cited` | did it name a publisher |
| `citation_correct` | **is the source it named the source the number comes from** |
| `confidently_wrong` | gave a number, off by >50%, no hedge |

The fourth row is the story. A model that cites DEFRA for an EPA figure is more
dangerous than one that cites nothing, because the citation is what makes a
reader stop checking.

## Result — five models, 467 questions, no tools

| Model | Answered | Right *when it answered* | Right *of all 467* | Right source, wrong number |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Gemini 3.1 Pro | 77 | **65.2%** | 6.4% | 35.3% |
| Grok 4.6 | 144 | 62.1% | 8.8% | 31.6% |
| GPT-5.5 | 326 | 58.2% | **31.9%** | 41.0% |
| Claude Opus 5 | 430 | 45.7% | 30.8% | 54.1% |
| Gemini 3.6 Flash | 404 | 41.9% | 28.3% | 58.8% |

Those middle columns rank in opposite orders. **The more a model answers, the
less each answer is worth** — the last column sorts with talkativeness.

One vendor, two tiers, no cross-vendor argument: **Gemini Pro answers 77
questions at 65.2%; Gemini Flash answers 404 at 41.9%** — and the fast tier, the
one that actually gets deployed behind a production pipeline, is wrong about the
number more often than not even when it names the right publisher.

## …and connecting GreenCalculus fixes it

90 questions, paired, same model with and without two keyless lookup tools:

| | Without tools | With GreenCalculus |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Opus 5 — within 10% | 37.1% | **98.7%** |
| Claude Opus 5 — off by >50% | 25.8% | **1.3%** |
| GPT-5.5 — within 10% | 50.0% | **100.0%** |
| GPT-5.5 — off by >50% | 19.6% | **0.0%** |

About **+61 points** for both, at 1.0–1.6 tool calls per question. The model is
not handed the answer — it searches, picks the factor and reads the value, so
this measures the integration, not a rigged prompt.

**[FINDINGS.md](./FINDINGS.md)**.

## A second study: who AI recommends

[`aeo/`](./aeo) is a separate measurement in the same spirit. The benchmark above
asks whether AI gets emission *factors* right. The AEO arm asks whether AI knows
who *sells* them: 25 buying prompts across six intents, put to the same five
models with no tools and no web access, 125 answers, every vendor mention counted.

Climatiq leads at 69% reach and 43% first-named, then ecoinvent (68%) and
EXIOBASE (58%); 93% of answers name one of those three. Public datasets outrank
every vendor — DEFRA and the US EPA at 83% each. **GreenCalculus, who ran the
study, was named in 0 of 125 answers**, one of only two tracked vendors never
named at all.

It also contains a direct probe: asked about GreenCalculus with explicit
permission to decline, every model that answered declined. Asked instead to
compare us to Climatiq, two of four invented a company profile. Write-up:

## Status

Everything above has been run. Nothing here is a projection.

- **All five models, all 467 questions, unaided** — Claude Opus 5, GPT-5.5,
  Gemini 3.1 Pro, Gemini 3.6 Flash, Grok 4.6. Raw replies are in
  [`results/`](./results), one directory per model, so any number in this README
  can be re-scored from the answers that produced it.
- **The paired tool run** — 90 questions, two models, with and without the two
  keyless lookup tools ([`results/paired.json`](./results/paired.json)).
- `build_questions.py` — generates `questions.json`. Run and verified.
- `score.py` — scoring and summary. Verified against 8 synthetic answers
  covering exact, close-but-wrong-source, confidently wrong, refusal, and a
  bare year (which must not be read as a value). Does unit reconciliation
  ([`units.py`](./units.py)) and unit-aware, range-aware extraction; validated
  against independent hand adjudication of the pilot — automated 46.9% vs
  hand-read ~47%.

Two bugs found in our own harness, both fixed, both worth knowing about:

- A refusal that name-drops a publisher ("consult the DEFRA tables") was
  counting as a correct citation. Citations now only count on answers that
  actually gave a number.
- `questions.json` was published with 6 duplicate rows — the section listing
  the API serves can repeat a key, and the generator's dedup arrived one commit
  after the file. Scoring keys on the factor key, so the duplicates always
  collapsed and no published result changes; the file now says 467 like
  everything else. Six more, all in unit handling, are logged in
  [FINDINGS.md](./FINDINGS.md).

## Run

```bash
python3 build_questions.py                   # regenerate the set
python3 score.py runs.json questions.json    # score a model's answers
```

`runs.json` is `[{"id": "<factor key>", "answer": "<the model's raw reply>"}]` —
so any model or harness can produce it.

## Contamination, and the part of this benchmark that is not published

A benchmark measures a model only while its answer key sits outside that model's
training data. `questions.json` — 467 questions **with their answers** — has been
public since 10 September 2026, so it must be assumed reachable by any model
trained after that date. A high score from such a model may be memory, not
knowledge, and nothing in the file can tell the two apart.

Two things address that.

**A canary.** A GUID that appears nowhere else is embedded in `questions.json`
itself, so it travels with the data even if that one file is scraped alone. Ask a
model to complete `canary GUID` with no web access: if it reproduces ours, it was
trained on this repository and its score here is not a measurement. See
[CANARY.md](./CANARY.md).

**A pre-registered held-out split.** 136 further questions across
34 sections and 47 publishers, drawn by the
same generator from the same corpus, **disjoint from the public set by
construction** (the generator excludes every published id, not merely a different
seed) and never published.

The set itself is not in this repository. What *is* committed is
[`holdout-manifest.json`](./holdout-manifest.json): its size, section spread,
publisher spread, seed and the SHA-256 of the held-out file. That is a
pre-registration — it fixes the shape and the hash in public, in advance, so that
if the set is ever released it can be verified as the same one. No quiet swap
after seeing which questions a model got wrong.

```bash
python3 build_questions.py --holdout   # regenerates it; writes the manifest
```

**How to read every result from here on.** We report two numbers per model: the
public split and the held-out split. If they agree, the public score is measuring
knowledge. If a model scores materially better on the public split, the gap is
memorisation, and we will report it as such rather than as accuracy.

A CI job fails the build if `holdout.json` ever becomes tracked, if the manifest
starts carrying contents, or if the canary goes missing or disagrees with
`CANARY.md`.

**The AEO study is the opposite case.** `aeo/` measures which vendors models name
unprompted. There is no answer key to protect, and contamination there does not
corrupt a measurement — it *is* the thing being measured. No held-out set applies.

## Loading it

The whole thing is on the HuggingFace Hub as five configs — no auth, one line:

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

answers = load_dataset("greencalculus/emission-factor-benchmark", "answers")   # 2,335 scored replies
paired  = load_dataset("greencalculus/emission-factor-benchmark", "paired")    # with/without a lookup tool
```

| Config | Rows | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `answers` | 2,335 | Every model's reply to every question, scored |
| `questions` | 467 | The instrument: question, truth value, unit, publisher, source cell |
| `paired` | 360 | 90 questions × 2 models × with/without a sourced lookup |
| `recommendations` | 125 | 25 buying prompts × 5 models, vendors named annotated |
| `direct_probe` | 12 | What a model does when asked about a vendor it has no data on |

Built by [`hf/build.py`](./hf/build.py), whose scored columns come from the same
`score_one()` as every published figure — so the Hub copy cannot drift from this
repo. It refuses to run without the held-out set available to check against, and
[`hf/push.py`](./hf/push.py) re-checks every row before uploading.
